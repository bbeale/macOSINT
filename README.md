Mapper (proper name TBD)

A toy map project that, with some additions, will become an OSINT tool.

Motivation comes from approx. 60% desire to get better at Swift and 40% desire to create one single OSINT tool to interface with others that I use separately.

TODO: 

- finish basic map implementation
- tweet annotation layer
- instagram post annotation layer
- update existing search function to search both of ^
